# particle_diffusion_6
MATLAB code for particle diffusion in two dimensions. Non-interacting particles in two dimensions with random initial velocity. Particles are bound in a box with a central disk. Particles reflect off of the box and disk with an angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence relative to the surface normal. The speed (or 'momentum') of the particle is conserved.
